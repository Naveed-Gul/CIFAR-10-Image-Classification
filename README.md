# Image Classification with CNN

### Overview:

The objective of this project is to build a deep learning model that can classify images into different categories using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The model is trained on a labeled dataset of images, such as CIFAR-10, to classify various objects into their respective categories.

### Objective:

Build a model to classify images into predefined categories using deep learning techniques.

### Description:

This project leverages the CIFAR-10 dataset, a well-known benchmark in computer vision, to train a convolutional neural network (CNN). The model will learn the features of different classes (e.g., airplanes, cars, birds, etc.) and use these learned features to classify unseen images into their respective categories.

### Dataset:

The CIFAR-10 dataset is used in this project and can be accessed via the following link: CIFAR-10 Dataset https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html. It contains 60,000 32x32 pixel images across 10 categories:
Airplanes, Automobiles, Birds, Cats, Deer, Dogs, Frogs, Horses, Ships, and Trucks.

Each category contains 6,000 images, and the dataset is divided into a training set of 50,000 images and a test set of 10,000 images.
